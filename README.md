# Anomaly-Detection-Notes

An outlier or anomaly is a data point that is noticeably different from the rest. They represent errors in measurement, bad data collection, or simply show variables not considered when collecting the data.

Anomaly detection is a statistical technique that identifies rare events, observations, or items that deviate from the majority of data and don't conform to a defined notion of normal behavior.
